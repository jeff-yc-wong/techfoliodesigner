Next steps:

## Login processing.
  - Do it once. If no credentials, then run it once more to get them. Avoid infinite loop.

## Implement github
  - Edit Splash screen to provide summary of configuration variables.
  - create github.js file to provide code for github.
  - create the github app.
  - implement the authentication code. (https://github.com/settings/applications/808028)

## Notes about initial version of designer:

Useful packages:

* electron-prebuilt-compile: Support for React, Less, ES7.
* front-matter: Parse YAML
* fs-extra: drop-in replacement for fs; provides async/await support
* jimp: image processing library
* marked: parses markdown into HTML
* nodegit: git commands in node
* octonode: github authentication and manipulation
* react-datepicker: datepicker
* electron-oauth-github: (Not currently used) electron module for authenticating your Electron app with GitHub.

Questionable packages

* html-react-parser: converts an HTML string to a React element.
* html-tidy2: clean up poorly formatted HTML
* superagent: HTTP GET, PUT, etc.

* [GitHub Authentication for Electron](https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/using-oauth-in-an-electron-application-abb0376c2ae0)

Code notes

* secret.js needs to be dealt with somehow.
