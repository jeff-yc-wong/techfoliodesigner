Next steps:

## Installing nodegit
  Node V10 blocker: https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/issues/1490
  Required prebuilt binary:
  https://axonodegit.s3.amazonaws.com/nodegit/nodegit/nodegit-v0.22.2-electron-v2.0-darwin-x64.tar.gz

## Clone
  - request the clone parent directory. Make sure it does not have a .git subdirectory.
  - if (authenticated && remote repo is specified and valid), then attempt to clone.
  - Once clone completed, set the local dir as the location where the cloned repo went.
  - rebuild menus.
  - Here's a nice package to try;: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodegit-clone

## Logout
  - probably have to run the https request to logout along with access_token to really logout.

## Notes about initial version of designer:

Useful packages:

* electron-prebuilt-compile: Support for React, Less, ES7.
* front-matter: Parse YAML
* fs-extra: drop-in replacement for fs; provides async/await support
* jimp: image processing library
* marked: parses markdown into HTML
* nodegit: git commands in node
* octonode: github authentication and manipulation
* react-datepicker: datepicker
* electron-oauth-github: (Not currently used) electron module for authenticating your Electron app with GitHub.

Questionable packages

* html-react-parser: converts an HTML string to a React element.
* html-tidy2: clean up poorly formatted HTML
* superagent: HTTP GET, PUT, etc.

* [GitHub Authentication for Electron](https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/using-oauth-in-an-electron-application-abb0376c2ae0)

Code notes

* secret.js needs to be dealt with somehow.
