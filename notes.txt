Next steps:

## Redux
  - download sample code, run through it to make sure it works and I understand it.
    - https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials/
  - Basic purpose:
    - Running git and github operations in main process; I want to communicate process and results to Splash window.
    - That requires electron-redux.
  - Later: merge "Managers" into redux.

Steps:
  - design state object
  - design actions and reducers
  - wrap the Splash window in a "Provider" element and pass the store.
  - Get the store and dispatch actions based on menu items.
  - Need to use thunk thing; potential interaction with electron-redux?
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX3KeP7v7Kg
     - Provides a good sequence of steps for switching over to Redux from regular react.
       - Set up page to get state from props.
       - Set up page to use connector so that store is available.
       - Implement store and a reducer that just returns a static state.
       - That should be enough to render the page with a static state.

## Logout
  - probably have to run the https request to logout along with removing access_token to really logout.

## Other menu item
  - display Splash window if hidden or deleted.
  - Edit config.yml file.

## Console logs -> app logging
  - search for console.logs, transition to in-app logging

## Signing the app

## File deletion
  - need to run 'git add <filename>' on deleted files.
  - no current way to delete files gracefully and get changes pushed to github.

## Notes about initial version of designer:

Useful packages:

* electron-prebuilt-compile: Support for React, Less, ES7.
* front-matter: Parse YAML
* fs-extra: drop-in replacement for fs; provides async/await support
* jimp: image processing library
* marked: parses markdown into HTML
* nodegit: git commands in node
* octonode: github authentication and manipulation
* react-datepicker: datepicker
* electron-oauth-github: (Not currently used) electron module for authenticating your Electron app with GitHub.

Questionable packages

* html-react-parser: converts an HTML string to a React element.
* html-tidy2: clean up poorly formatted HTML
* superagent: HTTP GET, PUT, etc.
