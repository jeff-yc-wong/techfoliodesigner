2) Go to "Clone Repo into Directory" in the Config menu, and select the folder where you would like to copy your online Techfolio to your computer for local editing.

3) Once you\'re done editing your techfolio, it's time to put it up online. Simply click "Push Changes to GitHub" in the Config menu.
