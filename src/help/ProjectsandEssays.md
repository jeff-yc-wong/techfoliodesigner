todo accessing text editor

Once you have created/opened your file for editing, you can write it using Techfolio's own text editor. Techfolio Designer comes with it's own TfLint technology, which parses your file for common mistakes most users make. TfLint will run when your file is saved (Ctrl/Cmd + S), or by using the keybinding (Ctrl/Cmd + L).
