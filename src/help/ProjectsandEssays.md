The main Techfolio Designer splash page contains a table of your Techfolio files that allows you to open them for editing, or delete them. 

Once you have created/opened your file for editing, you can write it using Techfolio's own text editor. Techfolio Designer comes with it's own TfLint technology, which parses your file for common mistakes most users make. TfLint will run when your file is saved (Ctrl/Cmd + S), or by using the keybinding (Ctrl/Cmd + L).
