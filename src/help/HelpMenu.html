        <p>Techfolio Designer comes with it&#39;s own TFLint technology, which parses your file for common mistakes most users make. TFLint will run when your file is saved (Ctrl/Cmd + S), or by using the keybinding (Ctrl/Cmd + L). The file will still be able to be saved and uploaded to your portfolio, but it is important to correct TfLint errors as they are often an indicator of poor writing quality, or errors that may cause your Techfolio to build incorrectly.</p>
